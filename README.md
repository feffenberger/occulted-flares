Analysis of results for the study of occulted flares, published in Effenberger et al. 2017, ApJ

We analyze two data sets of occulted flares from solar cycle 23 and 24 with different spectral fits, in their high and low energy spatial seperation and their light curves as correlated with the soft X-ray GOES flux. Additional STEREO height and equivalent GOES class information is included, when available.

This notebook gives the methods that were used to create the figures and do the analysis based on the results. The high level results are provided in two csv files 'Occulted_Results_23.csv' and 'Occulted_Results_24.csv'.

See the above publication for more details and please cite it if you use these results.
